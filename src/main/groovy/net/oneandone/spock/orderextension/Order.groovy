/**
 * Indicates that a spec's feature methods should be run sequentially

 * effects the complete spec hierarchy and gives the opportunity to define
 * dependencies between child and parent specs with the annotations:
 * {@code @After, @Before, @Between}.
 * Features of the child spec must be annotated so that order in relation
 * to the base specs is in a defined state.
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Order(skip = ['baseFeature1', 'baseFeature2'])
 * class Test extends Specification { }
 * }</pre>

 * Execution order is: {@code feature1 -> feature2}
